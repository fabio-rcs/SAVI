# sift.detect() function finds the keypoint in the images. 
# You can pass a mask if you want to search only a part of image. 
# Each keypoint is a special structure which has many attributes like its (x,y) coordinates, 
# size of the meaningful neighborhood, angle which specifies its orientation, response that specifies strength of keypoints etc.

# cv.drawKeyPoints() function draws the small circles on the locations of keypoints. 
# If you pass a flag, cv.DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS to it, it will draw a circle with size of keypoint and it will even show its orientation.
